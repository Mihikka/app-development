Problem statement-Creating a prototype for a web app to extract and populate details from resumes or CVs involves several components, including the user interface, backend processing, and integration with parsing algorithms.


Here's a simplified outline of the prototype:

*Frontend:*

1. *Homepage:* Provide a clean and user-friendly landing page with an option to upload a resume or CV.

2. *File Upload:* Implement a file upload feature where users can upload their resumes in PDF, Word, or text formats.

3. *Processing Indicator:* Display a loading indicator while the app processes the uploaded file.

4. *Results Display:* Once processing is complete, show the extracted information in a structured format.

*Backend:*

1. *File Parsing:* Utilize advanced parsing algorithms and libraries (e.g., PDFMiner, NLTK, or spaCy) to extract text and structure the document.

2. *Information Extraction:* Implement algorithms for extracting the required details such as name, email, mobile number, gender, highest qualification, college, branch, and year of graduation.

3. *Data Validation:* Validate extracted data to ensure accuracy and consistency.

4. *Database Integration:* Store the extracted information in a database for future access and analysis.

*Data Extraction Algorithms:*

1. *Name:* Utilize natural language processing (NLP) to identify and extract names based on patterns and capitalization.

2. *Email:* Use regular expressions to extract email addresses from the document.

3. *Mobile Number:* Employ regular expressions to identify and format phone numbers.

4. *Gender:* Use NLP and keyword-based approaches to identify gender-related terms in the document.

5. *Highest Qualification:* Implement keyword-based searches to identify common qualification terms.

6. *College:* Utilize NLP to identify educational institutions, or maintain a database of known colleges for matching.

7. *Branch and Year of Graduation:* Search for keywords and patterns that indicate the academic field and graduation year.
